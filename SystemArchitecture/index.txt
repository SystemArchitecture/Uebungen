Alice thought she had never seen such a they got settled down in a minute or two and the gamebegan  946
Alice found at first was in hands and feet to make thearches[Illustration]The chief difficulty  949
Alice soon cameto the conclusion were alwaysgetting up and walking off to other parts of the ground  957
Alice putdown her flamingo and began an account In another minute the whole head appeared and then  970
Alice began in rather acomplaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't fairly  973
Alice she's so extremely Just then she noticedthat the Queen was close behind her listening  979
Alice andlooking at the Cat's and passed onWho _are_ you talking to said the King coming up to  981

Alice could see it trying in that her flamingo was gone across to theother side of the garden where  996
Alice as all the arches are gone from this sideof the ground So she tucked it much thought  999
Alice talking at oncewhile all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortableThe moment  1003
Alice ventured to remarkTut tut child said the Duchess Every bitPerhaps it hasn't one  1028
Alice whispered that it's done by everybody mindingtheir own the world go round'Somebody said  1035
Alice thought to sounds will take care ofthemselves'How fond she is of finding morals in things  1038
Alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious tohave the experimentHe might bite  1041
Alice remarkedRight as that is'Birds of a feather flock together'Only mustard isn't a bird  1043
Alice said AliceOf course it is said the Duchess who seemed ready to agree toeverything that  1045
Alice who had not attended to this last the less there is ofyours'Oh I know exclaimed  1047
Alice said very politely ifI had it written otherwise'I think I should understand that better  1052

Alice thought toherself I don't see how he can _ever_ finish if he doesn't beginBut she minutes  1099
Alice was very nearly getting up from the Gryphon and the constantheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle  1102

happen shesaid to she uncorked it and put itto her lips I know _something_ interesting is sure to  381

Hatter He came in with a teacup in one handand a piece of witnessThe first witness was the  1292
Hatter looked at the March Hare who had followed him into thecourt arminarm did you beginThe  1295
Hatter added as an explanation I've none ofmy own I'm a factI keep them to sell the  1301
Hatter andjust as the Dormouse courtAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the  1314

Alice thought she had never seen such a they got settled down in a minute or two and the gamebegan  946
Alice found at first was in hands and feet to make thearches[Illustration]The chief difficulty  949
Alice soon cameto the conclusion were alwaysgetting up and walking off to other parts of the ground  957
Alice putdown her flamingo and began an account In another minute the whole head appeared and then  970
Alice began in rather acomplaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't fairly  973
Alice she's so extremely Just then she noticedthat the Queen was close behind her listening  979
Alice andlooking at the Cat's and passed onWho _are_ you talking to said the King coming up to  981

Alice I've read that me like thatHe got behind Alice as he spokeA cat may look at a king said  985
Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with theother the only difficulty was  995
Alice could see it trying in that her flamingo was gone across to theother side of the garden where  996
Alice as all the arches are gone from this sideof the ground So she tucked it much thought  999
Alice talking at oncewhile all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortableThe moment  1003
Alice ventured to remarkTut tut child said the Duchess Every bitPerhaps it hasn't one  1028
Alice whispered that it's done by everybody mindingtheir own the world go round'Somebody said  1035
Alice thought to sounds will take care ofthemselves'How fond she is of finding morals in things  1038
Alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious tohave the experimentHe might bite  1041
Alice remarkedRight as that is'Birds of a feather flock together'Only mustard isn't a bird  1043
Alice said AliceOf course it is said the Duchess who seemed ready to agree toeverything that  1045
Alice who had not attended to this last the less there is ofyours'Oh I know exclaimed  1047
Alice said very politely ifI had it written otherwise'I think I should understand that better  1052
Alice I'm glad they don't givebirthday presents said as yetA cheap sort of present thought  1056
Alice sharply for she was another dig of her sharp littlechinI've a right to think said  1058
Alice looked up her favourite word moral and the arm that was linkedinto hers began to tremble  1061
Alice and Alice was toomuch frightened to say a word but slowly with the game the Queen said to  1066

Alice did not quite like the look of the creature buton the whole she thought it would be quite as  1085
Alice as she went slowlyafter it I never was so ordered about in my life here thought  1090
Alice could hear him sighing as if sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they camenearer  1092
Alice thought toherself I don't see how he can _ever_ finish if he doesn't beginBut she minutes  1099
Alice was very nearly getting up from the Gryphon and the constantheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle  1102
Alice askedWe called him Tortoise because he taught us said the Mock Turtleangrily wasn't one  1107

Alice in a hurry tochange the subjectTen hours the first day said day did you do lessons said  1136
Alice and she thought over it a littlebefore she made her next remark Then the new idea to  1139
Alice went on eagerlyThat's enough about lessons the Gryphon interrupted manage on the twelfth  1141
Alice and tried to speak butfor a minute or two sobs choked his voice Same as if he had a at  1144
Alice beganto say I once tasted but checked herself hastily and introduced to a lobster  1148
Alice What sort of a dance is itWhy said the Gryphon you first form into a indeed said  1150
Alice timidlyWould you like to see a little of it AliceIt must be a very pretty dance said  1161
Alice said the Gryphon I've forgotten the wordsSo they began solemnly dancing round and round  1164
Alice won't you join the danceThank you it's a very interesting dance to watch said  1178
Alice I've as to the whiting said the Mock Turtle theyyou've seen themof courseYes said  1180

Alice quite hungry to look at themI wish of tarts upon it they looked sogood that it made  1261
Alice and at all comfortable and it was certainly notbecomingAnd that's the jurybox thought  1267
Alice wellThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates What are theyall doing  1272
Alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stoppedhastily for the White Rabbit cried out  1276
