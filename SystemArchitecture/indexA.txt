ALICE Blackandwhite _Enchanting  64
Alice a childish story take  125
Alice _Frontispiece_  172
ALICE was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her  216
Alice conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought  219
Alice think it There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that nor did  228
Alice started to her feet for it flashed across and then hurried on  234
Alice after it never once considering how In another moment down went  240
Alice had not a moment to think dipped suddenly down so suddenly that  244
Alice to herself After such a fall as this I shall Well thought  262
Alice had learnt several thousand miles down I think for you see  270
Alice had no idea what Latitude Latitude or Longitude I've got to  275
Alice soon began Down down down There was nothing else to do so  290
Alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a  296
Alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment  305
Alice like the wind and There was not a moment to be lost away went  308
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every  316
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not  329
Alice it doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor  334
Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really  338
Alice and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper before said  345
Alice was It was all very well to say Drink me but the wise little  349
Alice ventured to However this bottle was _not_ marked poison so  360
Alice I must be shutting up like a What a curious feeling said  367
Alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle I wonder  375
Alice when she got to the into the garden at once but alas for poor  381
Alice to herself Come there's no use in crying like that said  389
Alice to pretend to be two people But it's no use now thought poor  396
Alice and if it makes me grow larger I can reach the key and if it  402
Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but but  410
Alice she was so much CURIOUSER and curiouser cried  426
Alice or perhaps they won't canbut I must be kind to them thought  434
Alice It was as much as she could do lying down on one side to Poor  453
Alice a great girl like You ought to be ashamed of yourself said  457
Alice felt so Oh won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting  470
Alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she  476
Alice and her eyes I'm sure those are not the right words said poor  511
Alice with a sudden here till I'm somebody else'but oh dear cried  519
Alice a good deal frightened at the That _was_ a narrow escape said  532
Alice had been to the seaside once in railway she said to herself  543
Alice as she swam about trying I wish I hadn't cried so much said  551
Alice to speak to this mouse Would it be of any use now thought  562
Alice thought this must be the right of swimming about here O Mouse  566
Alice I daresay it's Perhaps it doesn't understand English thought  573
Alice had no very clear notion how long ago her knowledge of history  575
Alice hastily afraid that she had hurt Oh I beg your pardon cried  579
Alice in a soothing tone don't be angry Well perhaps not said  585
Alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the thing  588
Alice again for this time the Mouse was bristling all over and she  592
Alice in a great hurry to change the subject of I won't indeed said  602
Alice went on eagerly There is such a nice little dog near answer so  604
Alice in a pounds He says it kills all the rats andoh dear cried  610
Alice thought and it said in a its face was quite pale with passion  619
Alice led the a Lory and an Eaglet and several other curious creatures  625
Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had to  642
Alice would not allow without you and must know better and this  645
Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt in the middle  652
Alice as it spoke to  686
Alice in a melancholy tone doesn't seem to dry As wet as ever said  688
Alice not that she much wanted to know What _is_ a Caucusrace said  703
Alice with one Why _she_ of course said the Dodo pointing to  728
Alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her  732
Alice What else have you got in your pocket it went on turning to  746
Alice sadly Only a thimble said  748
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave  756
Alice and why You promised to tell me your history you know said  767
Alice and Mine is a long and sad tale said the Mouse turning to  773
Alice looking down with wonder It _is_ a long tail certainly said  776
Alice severely What are you You are not attending said the Mouse to  831
Alice very humbly you had got to the fifth I beg your pardon said  834
Alice always ready to make herself useful and looking A knot said  839
Alice But you're so easily offended I didn't mean it pleaded poor  845
Alice called after it And the Please come back and finish your story  850
Alice aloud addressing I wish I had our Dinah here I know I do said  860
Alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet  866
Alice was soon left alone On various pretexts they all moved off and  876
Alice began to cry again for she felt very any more And here poor  881
Alice guessed are ferrets Where _can_ I have dropped them I wonder  899
Alice as she went hunting about and Very soon the Rabbit noticed  906
Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at a fan Quick now And  909
Alice said to herself to be going messages for a How queer it seems  924
Alice Come began fancying the sort of thing that would happen 'Miss  926
Alice went on that the mouse doesn't get out' Only I don't think  929
Alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect Luckily for  959
Alice when one wasn't It was much pleasanter at home thought poor  964
Alice shall I _never_ get any older than I am now But then thought  975
Alice she answered herself How can you learn Oh you foolish  979
Alice knew it was Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs  988
Alice heard it say to itself Then I'll that attempt proved a failure  995
Alice and after waiting till she fancied _That_ you won't thought  998
Alice could only hear whispers There was a long silence after this and  1023
Alice I wonder what they'll do cucumberframes there must be thought  1028
Alice to Oh So Bill's got to come down the chimney has he said  1045
Alice Well I hardly knowNo more thank ye I'm better nowbut I'm  1063
Alice We must burn the house down said the Rabbit's voice And  1069
Alice thought to herself I There was a dead silence instantly and  1072
Alice heard the Rabbit say A barrowful will do to begin with  1075
Alice But she had not long to doubt A barrowful of _what_ thought  1077
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into  1083
Alice the moment she something out of a bottle They all made a rush at  1094
Alice to herself as she wandered The first thing I've got to do said  1098
Alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to thing said  1111
Alice dodged behind a great thistle and made believe to worry it then  1119
Alice thinking it was over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then  1122
Alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she This seemed to  1130
Alice as she leant And yet what a dear little puppy it was said  1134
Alice looked all round her at The great question certainly was what  1142
Alice looked at each other for some THE Caterpillar and  1164
Alice replied This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation  1170
Alice because I'm I can't explain _myself_ I'm afraid sir said  1178
Alice replied very politely I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly  1183
Alice but when you Well perhaps you haven't found it so yet said  1189
Alice all I know Well perhaps your feelings may be different said  1196
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such _very_  1202
Alice could not think of any Here was another puzzling question and as  1210
Alice turned and came back again This sounded promising certainly  1217
Alice swallowing down her anger as well as she Is that all said  1221
Alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and  1226
Alice I can't remember things as I I'm afraid I am sir said  1232
Alice replied in a very melancholy voice came different  1238
Alice folded her hands and began  1242
Alice timidly some of the Not _quite_ right I'm afraid said  1286
Alice hastily replied only one Oh I'm not particular as to size  1296
Alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in all her  1301
Alice three inches is such a wretched height to be mind said  1307
Alice in a piteous tone And she But I'm not used to it pleaded poor  1312
Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again In a This time  1319
Alice to One side of _what_ The other side of _what_ thought  1326
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying  1332
Alice in a tone of delight which Come my head's free at last said  1353
Alice And where have my What _can_ all that green stuff be said  1359
Alice indignantly Let me alone I'm _not_ a serpent said  1375
Alice I haven't the least idea what you're talking about said  1381
Alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in  1387
Alice who was beginning to I'm very sorry you've been annoyed said  1394
Alice I'm a I'm a But I'm _not_ a serpent I tell you said  1404
Alice rather doubtfully as she remembered II'm a little girl said  1410
Alice who was a very truthful I _have_ tasted eggs certainly said  1419
Alice that she was quite silent for a This was such a new idea to  1426
Alice hastily but I'm not It matters a good deal to _me_ said  1431
Alice crouched down among the trees as well as down again into its nest  1436
Alice it'll never do to come upon them _this_ lives there thought  1452
Alice noticed had powdered hair eyes like a frog and both footmen  1471
Alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood  1484
Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked  1489
Alice how am I to get in Please then said  1498
Alice thought decidedly uncivil But perhaps he can't help it this  1504
Alice again in a louder tone How am I to get in asked  1518
Alice did not like to be told so It's really It was no doubt only  1525
Alice But what am _I_ to do said  1533
Alice desperately he's Oh there's no use in talking to him said  1537
Alice said to herself There's certainly too much pepper in that soup  1545
Alice a little timidly for she was not Please would you tell me said  1554
Alice quite She said the last word with such sudden violence that  1560
Alice said very politely feeling quite I don't know of any that do  1569
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would  1574
Alice jumping up and down Oh _please_ mind what you're doing cried  1583
Alice who felt very glad to Which would _not_ be an advantage said  1594
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take  1601
Alice could hardly hear the words that  1623
Alice Here you may nurse it a bit if you like the Duchess said to  1634
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queershaped  1639
Alice The poor little thing was snorting like a starfish thought  1641
Alice the open air If I don't take this child away with me thought  1649
Alice that's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself said  1653
Alice looked very anxiously into its face to The baby grunted again and  1655
Alice did not eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether  1658
Alice seriously I'll have nothing more to do with you Mind said  1664
Alice was just beginning to think to herself Now what am I to do with  1668
Alice It looked goodnatured she The Cat only grinned when it saw  1686
Alice and she went on Would you Come it's pleased so far thought  1694
Alice I don't much care where said  1699
Alice added as an explanation so long as I get _somewhere_  1703
Alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question  1708
Alice remarked But I don't want to go among mad people  1715
Alice How do you know I'm mad said  1720
Alice didn't think that proved it at all however she went on And how  1724
Alice I suppose so said  1729
Alice _I_ call it purring not growling said  1735
Alice but I haven't been invited I should like it very much said  1740
Alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer  1745
Alice quietly said just as if it had come back It turned into a pig  1752
Alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not  1757

Alice indignantly and she sat coming There's _plenty_ of room said  1805
Alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea  1810

Alice conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while  1857
Alice he had taken his watch out of his is it he said turning to  1864
Alice considered a little and then said The fourth  1868
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity What a  1883
Alice replied very readily but that's because it Of course not  1890
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled The Hatter's remark seemed to have no  1895
Alice Have you guessed the riddle yet the Hatter said turning to  1905
Alice replied what's the answer No I give it up  1908
Alice sighed wearily I think you might do something better with the  1914
Alice I don't know what you mean said  1920
Alice cautiously replied but I know I have to beat time Perhaps not  1925
Alice thoughtfully but thenI That would be grand certainly said  1937
Alice asked Is that the way _you_ manage  1943
Alice I've heard something like it said  1955
Alice How dreadfully savage exclaimed  1971
Alice Then you keep moving round I suppose said  1982
Alice ventured But what happens when you come to the beginning again  1986
Alice rather alarmed at the I'm afraid I don't know one said  1992
Alice Yes please do pleaded  2003
Alice who always took a great interest in What did they live on said  2012

Alice replied in an offended tone so I can't I've had nothing yet  2029
Alice Nobody asked _your_ opinion said  2035
Alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to  2039
Alice was beginning very angrily but the There's no such thing  2046
Alice said very humbly I won't interrupt you No please go on  2051
Alice quite forgetting her promise What did they draw said  2058
Alice rather unwillingly took the moved into the Dormouse's place and  2066
Alice was a good deal worse off than advantage from the change and  2068
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again so she began very  2071
Alice said to the Dormouse not choosing But they were _in_ the well  2078
Alice that she let the Dormouse go on for This answer so confused poor  2083
Alice Why with an M said  2090
Alice was silent  2094
Alice very much confused I don't Really now you ask me said  2103
Alice could bear she got up in This piece of rudeness was more than  2108
Alice as she picked her At any rate I'll never go _there_ again said  2115
Alice thought this a very curious thing it busily painting them red  2143
Alice as she stood things when his eye chanced to fall upon  2165
Alice a little timidly why you are painting Would you tell me said  2169
Alice looked round eager to see the Queen and  2180
Alice recognised the White Rabbit it was talking in a hurried them  2189
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face  2195

Alice for protection to  2253
Alice and she put them into a large You shan't be beheaded said  2255
Alice as the question was The soldiers were silent and looked at  2267
Alice Yes shouted  2270
Alice joined the procession Come on then roared the Queen and  2272
Alice where's the Duchess Very said  2278

Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground in began  2300
Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo The chief difficulty  2308
Alice soon came getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground  2319
Alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any  2328
Alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded It's no use  2344
Alice put of them In another minute the whole head appeared and then  2346
Alice began in rather a I don't think they play at all fairly  2351
Alice she's so extremely Just then she noticed Not at all said  2364

Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the to  2405
Alice could see it trying in a helpless other side of the garden where  2407
Alice as all the arches are gone from this side matter much thought  2412
Alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle The moment  2421
Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the Duchess  2439
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought  2462
Alice ventured to remark Perhaps it hasn't one  2481
Alice did not much like her keeping so close to her first because the  2487
Alice whispered that it's done by everybody minding Somebody said  2497
Alice thought to herself How fond she is of finding morals in things  2505
Alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to He might bite  2511
Alice remarked Only mustard isn't a bird  2517
Alice It's a mineral I _think_ said  2522
Alice said there's a large mustardmine near here And everything that  2525
Alice who had not attended to this last remark Oh I know exclaimed  2529
Alice said very politely if I think I should understand that better  2538
Alice  2545
Alice I'm glad they don't give A cheap sort of present thought  2550
Alice sharply for she was beginning to I've a right to think said  2557

Alice I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is No said  2599
Alice I never saw one or heard of one said  2603
Alice heard the King say in a low voice to As they walked off together  2607
Alice alone executions I have ordered and she walked off leaving  2616
Alice did not quite like the look of the creature but with the Gryphon  2617
Alice half to itself half to  2623
Alice What _is_ the fun said  2625
Alice as she went slowly Everybody says 'come on' here thought  2630
Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break She nearer  2637
Alice thought to So they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes  2651
Alice was very nearly getting up and heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle  2660
Alice asked Why did you call him Tortoise if he wasn't one  2669
Alice who felt ready to sink into the earth At last the Gryphon said  2676
Alice I never said I didn't interrupted  2682
Alice could speak again Hold your tongue added the Gryphon before  2686
Alice you needn't be so proud _I've_ been to a dayschool too said  2692

Alice indignantly Certainly not said  2701
Alice living at the bottom of You couldn't have wanted it much said  2707
Alice What was that inquired  2713
Alice ventured to say What is it I never heard of 'Uglification'  2719
Alice doubtfully it meanstomakeanythingprettier Yes said  2724
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she  2729
Alice What was _that_ like said  2738
Alice in a hurry to And how many hours a day did you do lessons said  2752
Alice What a curious plan exclaimed  2758
Alice and she thought over it a little This was quite a new idea to  2763
Alice went on eagerly And how did you manage on the twelfth  2769
Alice and tried to speak but flapper across his eyes He looked at  2783
Alice You may not have lived much under the sea I haven't said  2789
Alice began and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster  2790
Alice What sort of a dance is it No indeed said  2795
Alice and quietly and looked at  2829
Alice timidly It must be a very pretty dance said  2831
Alice Very much indeed said  2835
Alice every now and then So they began solemnly dancing round and round  2842
Alice feeling Thank you it's a very interesting dance to watch said  2868
Alice I've often seen them at dinn she checked Yes said  2875
Alice replied thoughtfully They have their tails in I believe so  2881
Alice It's very interesting I never knew so much Thank you said  2894
Alice Why I never thought about it said  2900
Alice was thoroughly puzzled Does the boots and shoes she repeated  2904
Alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her  2910
Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity And what are they made of  2916
Alice whose thoughts were still running If I'd been the whiting said  2921
Alice in a tone of great surprise Wouldn't it really said  2928
Alice Don't you mean 'purpose' said  2933
Alice a little timidly but it's no use going back to yesterday  2942
Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first So  2950
Alice over  2964
Alice I might as well be at school at once However she got thought  2970

Alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come  3007
Alice was Yes I think you'd better leave off said the Gryphon and  3025
Alice Oh a song please if the Mock Turtle would be so kind  3031
Alice by the hand it hurried Come on cried the Gryphon and taking  3063

Alice quite hungry to look at themI wish they'd good that it made  3088
Alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read  3093
Alice and those twelve creatures And that's the jurybox thought  3102
Alice whispered to the Gryphon They can't have anything to all doing  3111
Alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped Stupid things  3119
Alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders  3124
Alice muddle their slates will be in before the trial's over thought  3128
Alice One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked This of course  3130
Alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled Just at this moment  3196
Alice very meekly I'm growing I can't help it said  3205
Alice more boldly you know you're growing Don't talk nonsense said  3209
Alice I've so often read in I'm glad I've seen that done thought  3270
Alice Now we shall get Come that finishes the guineapigs thought  3284
Alice guessed who it was even before she got into the her hand and  3300
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very  3333
Alice the name  3337
Alice quite forgetting in the flurry of HERE cried  3347
Alice as he said so with great emphasis looking hard at  3362
Alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she had put  3364
Alice What do you know about this business the King said to  3378
Alice Nothing said  3380
Alice Nothing whatever said  3384
Alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates  3397
Alice Everybody looked at  3404
Alice _I'm_ not a mile high said  3406
Alice besides that's not a Well I sha'n't go at any rate said  3412
Alice Then it ought to be Number One said  3417
Alice Why you don't It doesn't prove anything of the sort said  3460
Alice she had grown so large in If any of them can explain it said  3507
Alice But it goes on '_they all returned from him to you_' said  3533
Alice loudly The idea of having the Stuff and nonsense said  3556

Alice she had grown to her full size by Who cares for _you_ said  3566
Alice dear said her sister Why what a long sleep you've Wake up  3578
Alice and she told her Oh I've had such a curious dream said  3581

extraordinary way Alice tried a little to fancy to herself what such an  2023

eyelids so he with his nose As a duck with its  2977
eyes ran picking the daisies when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink  225
eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having  393
eyes to see what was coming It was the White she hastily dried her  466
eyes I'm sure those are not the right words said poor Alice and her  511
eyes inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little  570
eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt in the middle Alice kept her  652
eyes and An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round  1109
eyes half shut tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great  1128
eyes immediately met those of a large blue mushroom and her  1151
eyes like a frog and both footmen Alice noticed had powdered hair  1471
eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his she said to herself his  1505
eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether Alice did not  1658

eyes Of course of course just what I was going to remark myself  1903
eyes I wasn't asleep he said in a The Dormouse slowly opened his  1998
eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of its  2087
eyes by this time and was going off into a The Dormouse had closed its  2096
eyes appeared and then nodded It's no use Alice waited till the  2344
eyes then it watched the Queen till The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its  2621
eyes So they went up to the Mock Turtle who looked at them with large  2642
eyes He looked at Alice and tried to speak but flapper across his  2783
eyes Tell the reason is here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his  2886
eyes and mouths so _very_ wide but she gained courage as she went their  2953
eyes were after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his  3311
eyes were looking hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager  3598

I must be kind to them thought Alice or perhaps they won't canbut  434
I want to go Let me see I'll give them a new pair of walk the way  435

I wonder if I've been changed during the night Let me think _was_ I  479

I know is something comes at me a deal too flustered to tell youall  1064
I goes like a skyrocket like a Jackinthebox and up  1065
I There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to herself  1072

I suppose must make me smaller  1087
I think that will be thing is to find my way into that lovely garden  1100

I can't explain _myself_ I'm afraid sir said Alice because I'm  1178
I don't see said the Caterpillar  1181
I can't put it more clearly Alice replied very politely I'm afraid  1183
I can't understand it myself to begin with and being so many for  1184
I should think you'll feel it a little after that into a butterfly  1191
I know Well perhaps your feelings may be different said Alice all  1196
I think short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely  1203
I am sir said Alice I can't remember things as I I'm afraid  1232
I can't remember things as I I'm afraid I am sir said Alice  1232
I I'm afraid I am sir said Alice I can't remember things as  1232
I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together usedand  1233
I feared it might injure the brain  1250
I have none But now that I'm perfectly sure  1251
I do it again and again Why  1252
I mentioned before You are old said the youth as  1254
I kept all my limbs very supple  1260
I took to the law In my youth said his father  1269
I have answered three questions and that is enough  1279
I can listen all day to such stuff Do you think  1281
I _don't_ know said the Caterpillar  1299
I should like to be a _little_ larger sir if you wouldn't Well  1306
I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily thought to herself  1313
I ca'n't see you shoulders got to And oh my poor hands how is it  1360

I Pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as I was thinking  1400
I tell you said Alice I'm a I'm a But I'm _not_ a serpent  1404
I can see you're trying to Well _What_ are you said the Pigeon  1407
I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never use denying it  1416
I _have_ tasted eggs certainly said Alice who was a very truthful  1419
I don't believe it said the Pigeon but if they do why then  1423
I can say they're a kind of serpent that's all  1424
I know _that_ well enough and what does it matter to looking for eggs  1428
I was I shouldn't want _yours_ looking for eggs as it happens and if  1432
I shouldn't want _yours_ looking for eggs as it happens and if I was  1432
I don't like them raw  1433

I should frighten them out of their wits So she began size why  1453
I to get in Please then said Alice how am  1498
I could let you out you if you were _inside_ you might knock and  1502
I to get in head But at any rate he might answer questions How am  1506
I shall sit here the Footman remarked till tomorrow  1509
I to get in asked Alice again in a louder tone How am  1518

I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact I didn't know  1564
I didn't know I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact  1564
I don't know of any that do Alice said very politely feeling quite  1569

I hours I _think_ or is it twelve  1604
I never could abide Oh don't bother _me_ said the Duchess  1606
I speak severely to my boy  1625
I beat him when he sneezes  1626
I must go and get ready to play flinging the baby at her as she spoke  1635
I don't take this child away with me thought Alice the open air If  1649
I to do with Alice was just beginning to think to herself Now what am  1668
I get it home when it grunted again so violently this creature when  1669
I think And she began thinking over other rather a handsome pig  1677
I ought to go from here tell me please which way  1695
I don't much care where said Alice  1699
I get _somewhere_ Alice added as an explanation so long as  1703
I don't want to go among mad people Alice remarked But  1715
I suppose so said Alice  1729
I should like it very much said Alice but I haven't been invited  1740
I haven't been invited I should like it very much said Alice but  1740
I thought it would said the Cat and vanished again  1755
I said pig replied Alice and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and  1767
I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and I said pig replied Alice and  1767
I ever saw in all my life without a cat It's the most curious thing  1775
I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead  1786
I don't see any wine she remarked  1811
I didn't know it was _your_ table said Alice it's laid for a great  1820
I can guess that she added aloud begun asking riddlesI believe  1833
I do Alice hastily replied at leastat least I mean what I  1842
I mean what I I do Alice hastily replied at leastat least  1842
I I do Alice hastily replied at leastat least I mean what  1842
I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I well say that 'I see what  1846
I well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what  1846
I You might just as well say added the March Hare that 'I like what  1849
I like' get' is the same thing as 'I get what  1850
I sleep' is the same thing talking in his sleep that 'I breathe when  1853
I breathe' as 'I sleep when  1854
I told you butter would not suit Two days wrong sighed the Hatter  1870
I don't quite meaning in it and yet it was certainly English  1896
I was going to remark myself eyes Of course of course just what  1903
I give it up Alice replied what's the answer No  1908
I haven't the slightest idea said the Hatter  1910
I said the March Hare Nor  1912
I think you might do something better with the Alice sighed wearily  1914
I do said the Hatter you wouldn't talk If you knew Time as well as  1917
I don't know what you mean said Alice  1920
I daresay you never spoke to Time  1923
I know I have to beat time Perhaps not Alice cautiously replied but  1925
I have to beat time Perhaps not Alice cautiously replied but I know  1925
I learn music when  1926
I only wish it was the March Hare said to itself in a whisper  1935
I he replied We The Hatter shook his head mournfully Not  1945
I had to sing concert given by the Queen of Hearts and  1948
I wonder what you're at' How  1951
I ask It's always six o'clock now do a thing  1974
I suppose said Alice Then you keep moving round  1982
I vote the young lady tells us a story I'm getting tired of this  1990
I don't know one said Alice rather alarmed at the I'm afraid  1992
I wasn't asleep he said in a The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes  1998
I heard every word you fellows were saying hoarse feeble voice  1999
I can't I've had nothing yet Alice replied in an offended tone so  2029
I won't interrupt you No please go on Alice said very humbly  2051
I dare say there may be _one_ again  2052
I want a clean cup interrupted the Hatter let's all move one place  2062
I don't understand Where did they draw the treacle cautiously But  2072
I should You can draw water out of a waterwell said the Hatter so  2075
I don't Really now you ask me said Alice very much confused  2103
I ever was at in all way through the wood It's the stupidest teaparty  2116
I think I may as well go in at once And everything's curious today  2121
I may as well go in at once And everything's curious today I think  2121
I couldn't help it said Five in a sulky tone Seven jogged my  2148
I heard the Queen say only _You'd_ better not talk said Five  2154
I needn't be afraid of them all  2211
I didn't said Alice I don't think it's at all a pity I said No  2289

I don't think they play at all fairly Alice began in rather a  2351
I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now only groundand  2357
I don't like the look of it at all said the King however it may  2376
I don't remember where but  2385
I wish you would to the Queen who was passing at the moment My dear  2388
I am to see you again you YOU can't think how glad  2458
I won't have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_ Soup does very though  2467
I only wish people knew _that_ then they wouldn't be sweettempered  2472
I can't about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk  2477
I shall remember it in tell you just now what the moral of that is but  2478
I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist  2507
I don't put my arm round your waist I dare say you're wondering why  2507
I try the experiment the temper of your flamingo Shall  2509
I _think_ said Alice It's a mineral  2522
I know exclaimed Alice who had not attended to this last remark Oh  2529
I quite agree with you said the Duchess and the moral of that  2532
I think I should understand that better Alice said very politely if  2538
I should understand that better Alice said very politely if I think  2538
I had it written down but I can't quite follow it as you say it  2539

I make you a present Oh don't talk about trouble said the Duchess  2547
I give you fair warning shouted the Queen stamping on the Now  2570
I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is No said Alice  2599
I never saw one or heard of one said Alice  2603
I must go back and see after some Turtle and to hear his history  2615
I have ordered and she walked off leaving Alice alone executions  2616
I never was so ordered about in my life never after it  2631
I don't see how he can _ever_ finish if he doesn't begin herself  2652
I was a real Once said the Mock Turtle at last with a deep sigh  2655
I never said I didn't interrupted Alice  2682
I didn't interrupted Alice I never said  2682
I couldn't afford to learn it said the Mock Turtle with a sigh I  2710
I I couldn't afford to learn it said the Mock Turtle with a sigh  2710
I never heard of 'Uglification' Alice ventured to say What is it  2719
I suppose uglifying it exclaimed You know what to beautify is  2722
I can't show it you myself the Mock Turtle said I'm too Well  2740
I went to the Classical master Hadn't time said the Gryphon  2743
I never went to him the Mock Turtle said with a sigh he taught  2746
I haven't said Alice You may not have lived much under the sea  2789
I once tasted but checked herself hastily and said No to say  2791
I do so like that curious song very glad that it was over at last and  2869
I don't know where Dinn may be said the Mock Turtle but if you've  2878
I believe so Alice replied thoughtfully They have their tails in  2881
I never knew so much Thank you said Alice It's very interesting  2894
I can tell you more than that if you like said the Gryphon Do you  2897
I never thought about it said Alice Why  2900
I mean what Why what are _your_ shoes done with said the Gryphon  2907
I believe answer They're done with blacking  2911
I should say 'With what porpoise' told me he was going a journey  2931
I mean what I say the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone And  2935
I say the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone And I mean what  2935
I could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning said  2941
I was a different person then because  2943
I It all came different the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully  2961
I might as well be at school at once However she got thought Alice  2970
I heard him declare 'Tis the voice of the Lobster  2975
I must sugar my hair' 'You have baked me too brown  2976
I was a child said That's different from what _I_ used to say when  2984
I should like to have it explained said the Mock Turtle  2993
I passed by his garden and marked with one eye  3010
I think you'd better leave off said the Gryphon and Alice was Yes  3025
I suppose they are the jurors She said animals and some were birds  3104
I beg pardon your and a piece of breadandbutter in the other  3157

I was sent for my tea when  3159
I _think_ it court arminarm with the Dormouse Fourteenth of March  3164
I keep them to sell the Hatter added as an explanation I've none of  3182
I wish you wouldn't squeeze so said the Dormouse who was sitting  3202
I can hardly breathe next to her  3203
I can't help it said Alice very meekly I'm growing  3205
I hadn't begun my teanot above a week or soand what with the and  3225
I didn't the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry  3238
I deny it said the March Hare  3242
I cut some more After that continued the Hatter  3250
I can't remember said the Hatter That  3255
I will just the officers of the court As that is rather a hard word  3265
I never understood what it meant till now court' and  3273

I must I must the King said with a melancholy air and Well if  3310
I must the King said with a melancholy air and Well if I must  3310
I _beg_ your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and Oh  3354
I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the trial to herself  3368
I meant the King hastily said and went on _Un_important of course  3392
I sha'n't go at any rate said Alice besides that's not a Well  3412
I haven't opened it yet said the White Rabbit but it seems to be a  3428
I didn't write it and they Please your Majesty said the Knave  3448
I did there's no name signed at the end can't prove that  3449
I begin please The White Rabbit put on his spectacles Where shall  3465

I gave her one they gave him two  3484
I or she should chance to be If  3489
I don't trouble you know as we needn't try to find any And yet  3517
I seem to see some meaning in them after all them with one eye  3519
I could not swim_' you can't swim can you he added '_said  3520
I look like it he said Which he The Knave shook his head sadly Do  3523
I think he said to she had this fit_' you never had _fits_ my dear  3537
I won't said Alice  3561
I'd better take him surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am But  914
I'd leaves I should have liked teaching it tricks very much ifif  1136
I'd nearly forgotten that only been the right size to do it Oh dear  1137
I'd taken the highest tree in the wood continued the And just as  1399
I'd nearly Bythebye what became of the baby said the Cat  1749
I'd gone to see the Hatter instead I almost wish  1786
I'd hardly finished the first verse said the Hatter when the Well  1967

sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the though still  2666
sobs choked his voice Same as if he had a bone in for a minute or two  2784
sobs The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice choked with  3036
sobs of the miserable Mock filled the air mixed up with the distant  3613

that's the queerest thing No they're not said the White Rabbit and  3442
That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet said the  3504

themall sorts of when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about  3082
themand it belongs to a sorts of thingsI can't remember half of  608
themand you've no idea how least if there are nobody attends to  2354
themI wish they'd good that it made Alice quite hungry to look at  3088

thenalways to have lessons to learn Oh I shouldn't like _that_  977
thenI That would be grand certainly said Alice thoughtfully but  1937
there's no use in crying like that said Alice to herself Come  389
there's hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable person Why  397
there's no harm in trying So she likely it can talk at any rate  564
there's no room to grow up any more added in a sorrowful tone at least  972
there's hardly room for _you_ and no room at all lessons in here Why  980
There's no pleasing them serpents  1385
there's no _one_ with such a neck as that No no You're a serpent and  1415
there's half my plan done and began talking to herself as usual Come  1446
There's no use in knocking said the Footman and that for two  1491
there's no use in talking to him said Alice desperately he's Oh  1537
There's certainly too much pepper in that soup Alice said to herself  1545
There's _plenty_ of room said Alice indignantly and she sat coming  1805
There's no such thing Alice was beginning very angrily but the  2046
there's any one fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that  2331
there's the confusing it is all the things being alive for instance  2355
there's a large mustardmine near here And everything that Alice said  2525
There's a porpoise close behind us and he's treading on my tail  2848
There's a great Not yet not yet the Rabbit hastily interrupted  3150
There's more evidence to come yet please your Majesty said the White  3422
there's It isn't directed at all said the White Rabbit in fact  3436
there's no name signed at the end can't prove that I did  3449
there's an atom of meaning in I'll give him sixpence _I_ don't believe  3509
there's The jury all wrote down on their slates _She_ doesn't believe  3512
there's no meaning in it said the King that saves a world of If  3516
they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people that  930
they'd take the wonder what they _will_ do next If they had any sense  1073
they'd They couldn't have done that you know Alice gently remarked  2018
they'd good that it made Alice quite hungry to look at themI wish  3088
they'll all think me at think nothing of tumbling down stairs How brave  263
they'll remember her saucer of milk at Dinah was the cat I hope  292

they'll do together firstthey don't reach half high enough yetOh  1037
they're a kind of serpent that's all I can say  1424
they're making such a noise inside no one could secondly because  1493
they're sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn't it be murder to leave  1650
they're both mad Hare Visit either you like  1713
they're only a pack of cards after but she added to herself Why  2210
They're dreadfully and then thought she what would become of me  2330

went Alice after it never once considering how In another moment down  240
went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then The rabbithole  243
went down to look about her and to wonder what plenty of time as she  251
went on saying to herself in a Alice began to get rather sleepy and  296
went Alice like the wind and There was not a moment to be lost away  308
went There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she  341
went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach  383
went on planning to herself how she would manage it They must And she  438
went on all the same shedding gallons of moment I tell you But she  459
went on talking Dear dear How kept fanning herself all the time she  477
went on just as usual queer everything is today And yesterday things  478
went on I must be Mabel after all and filled with tears again as she  512
went to the table to measure growing small again She got up and  526
went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the thing Alice  588
went on eagerly There is such a nice little dog near answer so Alice  604
went commotion in the pool as it  613
went on 'found The Mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly  682
went on turning to Alice What else have you got in your pocket it  746
went as if it had lost something and she looking anxiously about as it  896
went hunting about and Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice as she  906
went in without plate with the name W RABBIT engraved upon it She  917
went on that the mouse doesn't get out' Only I don't think Alice  929
went on growing and growing Alas it was too late to wish that She  951
went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out Still she  955
went on taking first one side and then the other and making And so she  983
went mushroom and crawled away into the grass merely remarking as it  1322
went on without attending to her but those hedges the Pigeon  1384
went timidly up to the door and knocked Alice  1489
went on There might be some sense in your knocking the Footman  1500
went in perfectly idiotic And she opened the door and  1538
went on again and not to her so she took courage and  1562
went out but it just missed her a fryingpan after her as she  1637
went on for some while in silence to say which and they  1666
went on Would you Come it's pleased so far thought Alice and she  1694
went on And how Alice didn't think that proved it at all however she  1724
went on you see a dog growls when it's angry Well then the Cat  1731
went on Then you should say what you mean the March Hare  1840
went mad you know quarrelled last Marchjust before _he_  1946
went on so long that they _Twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle_ and  1964

went on yawning and rubbing They were learning to draw the Dormouse  2086
went on that begins with an M such as little shriek and  2098
went in she  2122
went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she and she  2144
went by without nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and  2190
went on What's your name child Alice she  2207
went on What _have_ you been doing turning to the rosetree she  2241
went stamping about and the Queen was in a furious passion and  2324
went on that the Queen was close behind her listening so she  2365
went in search of her hedgehog whether it was her turn or not So she  2402
went back for a little more conversation with her friend again and  2414
went off like an arrow And the executioner  2443
went back to the game the rest of the party  2448
went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule she  2469
went slowly Everybody says 'come on' here thought Alice as she  2630
went up to the Mock Turtle who looked at them with large eyes So they  2642
went on at last more calmly When we were little the Mock Turtle  2665
went to school in the though still sobbing a little now and then we  2666
went on in these words and he  2678

went on eagerly And how did you manage on the twelfth Alice  2769
went on again and with tears running down his cheeks  2787
went on you throw the Then you know the Mock Turtle  2813
went on in a deep voice Boots and shoes under the sea the Gryphon  2913
went their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide but she gained courage as she  2953
went on in a trembling voice wrong and she  3008
went Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille the Gryphon  3028
went round the court and got behind him and could _not_ stand and she  3131
went on and most things twinkled after I'm a poor man the Hatter  3235
went on looking Well at any rate the Dormouse said the Hatter  3246
went The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter and  3259
went on _Un_important of course I meant the King hastily said and  3392
went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at know he  3518

_something_ interesting is sure to happen she to her lips I know  939
_somewhere_ Alice added as an explanation so long as I get  1703

Alice a childish story take  125
Alice _Frontispiece_  172
ALICE was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her  216
Alice conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought  219
Alice think it There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that nor did  228
Alice started to her feet for it flashed across and then hurried on  234
Alice after it never once considering how In another moment down went  240
Alice had not a moment to think dipped suddenly down so suddenly that  244
Alice to herself After such a fall as this I shall Well thought  262
Alice had learnt several thousand miles down I think for you see  270
Alice had no idea what Latitude Latitude or Longitude I've got to  275
Alice soon began Down down down There was nothing else to do so  290
Alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a  296
Alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment  305
Alice like the wind and There was not a moment to be lost away went  308
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every  316
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not  329
Alice it doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor  334
Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really  338
Alice and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper before said  345
Alice was It was all very well to say Drink me but the wise little  349
Alice ventured to However this bottle was _not_ marked poison so  360
Alice I must be shutting up like a What a curious feeling said  367
Alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle I wonder  375
Alice when she got to the into the garden at once but alas for poor  381
Alice to herself Come there's no use in crying like that said  389
Alice to pretend to be two people But it's no use now thought poor  396
Alice and if it makes me grow larger I can reach the key and if it  402
Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but but  410
Alice she was so much CURIOUSER and curiouser cried  426
Alice or perhaps they won't canbut I must be kind to them thought  434
Alice It was as much as she could do lying down on one side to Poor  453
Alice a great girl like You ought to be ashamed of yourself said  457
Alice felt so Oh won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting  470
Alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she  476
Alice and her eyes I'm sure those are not the right words said poor  511
Alice with a sudden here till I'm somebody else'but oh dear cried  519
Alice a good deal frightened at the That _was_ a narrow escape said  532
Alice had been to the seaside once in railway she said to herself  543
Alice as she swam about trying I wish I hadn't cried so much said  551
Alice to speak to this mouse Would it be of any use now thought  562
Alice thought this must be the right of swimming about here O Mouse  566
Alice I daresay it's Perhaps it doesn't understand English thought  573
Alice had no very clear notion how long ago her knowledge of history  575
Alice hastily afraid that she had hurt Oh I beg your pardon cried  579
Alice in a soothing tone don't be angry Well perhaps not said  585
Alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the thing  588
Alice again for this time the Mouse was bristling all over and she  592
Alice in a great hurry to change the subject of I won't indeed said  602
Alice went on eagerly There is such a nice little dog near answer so  604
Alice in a pounds He says it kills all the rats andoh dear cried  610
Alice thought and it said in a its face was quite pale with passion  619
Alice led the a Lory and an Eaglet and several other curious creatures  625
Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had to  642
Alice would not allow without you and must know better and this  645
Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt in the middle  652
Alice as it spoke to  686
Alice in a melancholy tone doesn't seem to dry As wet as ever said  688
Alice not that she much wanted to know What _is_ a Caucusrace said  703
Alice with one Why _she_ of course said the Dodo pointing to  728
Alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her  732
Alice What else have you got in your pocket it went on turning to  746
Alice sadly Only a thimble said  748
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave  756
Alice and why You promised to tell me your history you know said  767
Alice and Mine is a long and sad tale said the Mouse turning to  773
Alice looking down with wonder It _is_ a long tail certainly said  776
Alice severely What are you You are not attending said the Mouse to  831
Alice very humbly you had got to the fifth I beg your pardon said  834
Alice always ready to make herself useful and looking A knot said  839
Alice But you're so easily offended I didn't mean it pleaded poor  845
Alice called after it And the Please come back and finish your story  850
Alice aloud addressing I wish I had our Dinah here I know I do said  860
Alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet  866
Alice was soon left alone On various pretexts they all moved off and  876
Alice began to cry again for she felt very any more And here poor  881
Alice guessed are ferrets Where _can_ I have dropped them I wonder  899
Alice as she went hunting about and Very soon the Rabbit noticed  906
Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at a fan Quick now And  909
Alice said to herself to be going messages for a How queer it seems  924
Alice Come began fancying the sort of thing that would happen 'Miss  926
Alice went on that the mouse doesn't get out' Only I don't think  929
Alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect Luckily for  959
Alice when one wasn't It was much pleasanter at home thought poor  964
Alice shall I _never_ get any older than I am now But then thought  975
Alice she answered herself How can you learn Oh you foolish  979
Alice knew it was Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs  988
Alice heard it say to itself Then I'll that attempt proved a failure  995
Alice and after waiting till she fancied _That_ you won't thought  998
Alice could only hear whispers There was a long silence after this and  1023
Alice I wonder what they'll do cucumberframes there must be thought  1028
Alice to Oh So Bill's got to come down the chimney has he said  1045
Alice Well I hardly knowNo more thank ye I'm better nowbut I'm  1063
Alice We must burn the house down said the Rabbit's voice And  1069
Alice thought to herself I There was a dead silence instantly and  1072
Alice heard the Rabbit say A barrowful will do to begin with  1075
Alice But she had not long to doubt A barrowful of _what_ thought  1077
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into  1083
Alice the moment she something out of a bottle They all made a rush at  1094
Alice to herself as she wandered The first thing I've got to do said  1098
Alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to thing said  1111
Alice dodged behind a great thistle and made believe to worry it then  1119
Alice thinking it was over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then  1122
Alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she This seemed to  1130
Alice as she leant And yet what a dear little puppy it was said  1134
Alice looked all round her at The great question certainly was what  1142
Alice looked at each other for some THE Caterpillar and  1164
Alice replied This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation  1170
Alice because I'm I can't explain _myself_ I'm afraid sir said  1178
Alice replied very politely I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly  1183
Alice but when you Well perhaps you haven't found it so yet said  1189
Alice all I know Well perhaps your feelings may be different said  1196
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such _very_  1202
Alice could not think of any Here was another puzzling question and as  1210
Alice turned and came back again This sounded promising certainly  1217
Alice swallowing down her anger as well as she Is that all said  1221
Alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and  1226
Alice I can't remember things as I I'm afraid I am sir said  1232
Alice replied in a very melancholy voice came different  1238
Alice folded her hands and began  1242
Alice timidly some of the Not _quite_ right I'm afraid said  1286
Alice hastily replied only one Oh I'm not particular as to size  1296
Alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in all her  1301
Alice three inches is such a wretched height to be mind said  1307
Alice in a piteous tone And she But I'm not used to it pleaded poor  1312
Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again In a This time  1319
Alice to One side of _what_ The other side of _what_ thought  1326
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying  1332
Alice in a tone of delight which Come my head's free at last said  1353
Alice And where have my What _can_ all that green stuff be said  1359
Alice indignantly Let me alone I'm _not_ a serpent said  1375
Alice I haven't the least idea what you're talking about said  1381
Alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in  1387
Alice who was beginning to I'm very sorry you've been annoyed said  1394
Alice I'm a I'm a But I'm _not_ a serpent I tell you said  1404
Alice rather doubtfully as she remembered II'm a little girl said  1410
Alice who was a very truthful I _have_ tasted eggs certainly said  1419
Alice that she was quite silent for a This was such a new idea to  1426
Alice hastily but I'm not It matters a good deal to _me_ said  1431
Alice crouched down among the trees as well as down again into its nest  1436
Alice it'll never do to come upon them _this_ lives there thought  1452
Alice noticed had powdered hair eyes like a frog and both footmen  1471
Alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood  1484
Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked  1489
Alice how am I to get in Please then said  1498
Alice thought decidedly uncivil But perhaps he can't help it this  1504
Alice again in a louder tone How am I to get in asked  1518
Alice did not like to be told so It's really It was no doubt only  1525
Alice But what am _I_ to do said  1533
Alice desperately he's Oh there's no use in talking to him said  1537
Alice said to herself There's certainly too much pepper in that soup  1545
Alice a little timidly for she was not Please would you tell me said  1554
Alice quite She said the last word with such sudden violence that  1560
Alice said very politely feeling quite I don't know of any that do  1569
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would  1574
Alice jumping up and down Oh _please_ mind what you're doing cried  1583
Alice who felt very glad to Which would _not_ be an advantage said  1594
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take  1601
Alice could hardly hear the words that  1623
Alice Here you may nurse it a bit if you like the Duchess said to  1634
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queershaped  1639
Alice The poor little thing was snorting like a starfish thought  1641
Alice the open air If I don't take this child away with me thought  1649
Alice that's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself said  1653
Alice looked very anxiously into its face to The baby grunted again and  1655
Alice did not eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether  1658
Alice seriously I'll have nothing more to do with you Mind said  1664
Alice was just beginning to think to herself Now what am I to do with  1668
Alice It looked goodnatured she The Cat only grinned when it saw  1686
Alice and she went on Would you Come it's pleased so far thought  1694
Alice I don't much care where said  1699
Alice added as an explanation so long as I get _somewhere_  1703
Alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question  1708
Alice remarked But I don't want to go among mad people  1715
Alice How do you know I'm mad said  1720
Alice didn't think that proved it at all however she went on And how  1724
Alice I suppose so said  1729
Alice _I_ call it purring not growling said  1735
Alice but I haven't been invited I should like it very much said  1740
Alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer  1745
Alice quietly said just as if it had come back It turned into a pig  1752
Alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not  1757
Alice and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and I said pig replied  1767
Alice but a grin Well I've often seen a cat without a grin thought  1774
Alice only as head Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse thought  1800
Alice one corner of it No room No room they cried out when they saw  1804
Alice indignantly and she sat coming There's _plenty_ of room said  1805
Alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea  1810
Alice angrily Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it said  1815
Alice it's laid for a great I didn't know it was _your_ table said  1820
Alice Your hair wants cutting said the Hatter He had been looking at  1823
Alice said with some You should learn not to make personal remarks  1826
Alice I'm glad they've Come we shall have some fun now thought  1832
Alice Exactly so said  1838
Alice hastily replied at leastat least I mean what I I do  1842
Alice conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while  1857
Alice he had taken his watch out of his is it he said turning to  1864
Alice considered a little and then said The fourth  1868
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity What a  1883
Alice replied very readily but that's because it Of course not  1890
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled The Hatter's remark seemed to have no  1895
Alice Have you guessed the riddle yet the Hatter said turning to  1905
Alice replied what's the answer No I give it up  1908
Alice sighed wearily I think you might do something better with the  1914
Alice I don't know what you mean said  1920
Alice cautiously replied but I know I have to beat time Perhaps not  1925
Alice thoughtfully but thenI That would be grand certainly said  1937
Alice asked Is that the way _you_ manage  1943
Alice I've heard something like it said  1955
Alice How dreadfully savage exclaimed  1971
Alice Then you keep moving round I suppose said  1982
Alice ventured But what happens when you come to the beginning again  1986
Alice rather alarmed at the I'm afraid I don't know one said  1992
Alice Yes please do pleaded  2003
Alice who always took a great interest in What did they live on said  2012
Alice gently remarked they'd They couldn't have done that you know  2018
Alice tried a little to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way  2023
Alice very earnestly Take some more tea the March Hare said to  2027
Alice replied in an offended tone so I can't I've had nothing yet  2029
Alice Nobody asked _your_ opinion said  2035
Alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to  2039
Alice was beginning very angrily but the There's no such thing  2046
Alice said very humbly I won't interrupt you No please go on  2051
Alice quite forgetting her promise What did they draw said  2058
Alice rather unwillingly took the moved into the Dormouse's place and  2066
Alice was a good deal worse off than advantage from the change and  2068
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again so she began very  2071
Alice said to the Dormouse not choosing But they were _in_ the well  2078
Alice that she let the Dormouse go on for This answer so confused poor  2083
Alice Why with an M said  2090
Alice was silent  2094
Alice very much confused I don't Really now you ask me said  2103
Alice could bear she got up in This piece of rudeness was more than  2108
Alice as she picked her At any rate I'll never go _there_ again said  2115
Alice thought this a very curious thing it busily painting them red  2143
Alice as she stood things when his eye chanced to fall upon  2165
Alice a little timidly why you are painting Would you tell me said  2169
Alice looked round eager to see the Queen and  2180
Alice recognised the White Rabbit it was talking in a hurried them  2189
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face  2195
Alice they all stopped and looked When the procession came opposite to  2202
Alice she went on What's your name child  2207
Alice so please your Majesty said Alice very politely My name is  2209
Alice very politely My name is Alice so please your Majesty said  2209
Alice surprised at her own courage It's How should _I_ know said  2219
Alice very loudly and decidedly and the Queen was Nonsense said  2225
Alice for protection to  2253
Alice and she put them into a large You shan't be beheaded said  2255
Alice as the question was The soldiers were silent and looked at  2267
Alice Yes shouted  2270
Alice joined the procession Come on then roared the Queen and  2272
Alice where's the Duchess Very said  2278
Alice What for said  2285
Alice I don't think it's at all a pity I said No I didn't said  2289
Alice gave a little She boxed the Queen's ears the Rabbit began  2292
Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground in began  2300
Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo The chief difficulty  2308
Alice soon came getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground  2319
Alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any  2328
Alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded It's no use  2344
Alice put of them In another minute the whole head appeared and then  2346
Alice began in rather a I don't think they play at all fairly  2351
Alice she's so extremely Just then she noticed Not at all said  2364
Alice and Who _are_ you talking to said the King coming up to  2370
Alice allow me to It's a friend of minea Cheshire Cat said  2373
Alice as he spoke He got behind  2382
Alice I've read that in some book A cat may look at a king said  2384
Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going  2397
Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the to  2405
Alice could see it trying in a helpless other side of the garden where  2407
Alice as all the arches are gone from this side matter much thought  2412
Alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle The moment  2421
Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the Duchess  2439
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought  2462
Alice ventured to remark Perhaps it hasn't one  2481
Alice did not much like her keeping so close to her first because the  2487
Alice whispered that it's done by everybody minding Somebody said  2497
Alice thought to herself How fond she is of finding morals in things  2505
Alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to He might bite  2511
Alice remarked Only mustard isn't a bird  2517
Alice It's a mineral I _think_ said  2522
Alice said there's a large mustardmine near here And everything that  2525
Alice who had not attended to this last remark Oh I know exclaimed  2529
Alice said very politely if I think I should understand that better  2538
Alice  2545
Alice I'm glad they don't give A cheap sort of present thought  2550
Alice sharply for she was beginning to I've a right to think said  2557
Alice looked up and there stood the Queen into hers began to tremble  2565
Alice and Alice was too Let's go on with the game the Queen said to  2576
Alice was too Let's go on with the game the Queen said to Alice and  2576
Alice were in custody and players except the King the Queen and  2593
Alice Have Then the Queen left off quite out of breath and said to  2596
Alice I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is No said  2599
Alice I never saw one or heard of one said  2603
Alice heard the King say in a low voice to As they walked off together  2607
Alice alone executions I have ordered and she walked off leaving  2616
Alice did not quite like the look of the creature but with the Gryphon  2617
Alice half to itself half to  2623
Alice What _is_ the fun said  2625
Alice as she went slowly Everybody says 'come on' here thought  2630
Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break She nearer  2637
Alice thought to So they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes  2651
Alice was very nearly getting up and heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle  2660
Alice asked Why did you call him Tortoise if he wasn't one  2669
Alice who felt ready to sink into the earth At last the Gryphon said  2676
Alice I never said I didn't interrupted  2682
Alice could speak again Hold your tongue added the Gryphon before  2686
Alice you needn't be so proud _I've_ been to a dayschool too said  2692
Alice we learned French and music Yes said  2697
Alice indignantly Certainly not said  2701
Alice living at the bottom of You couldn't have wanted it much said  2707
Alice What was that inquired  2713
Alice ventured to say What is it I never heard of 'Uglification'  2719
Alice doubtfully it meanstomakeanythingprettier Yes said  2724
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she  2729
Alice What was _that_ like said  2738
Alice in a hurry to And how many hours a day did you do lessons said  2752
Alice What a curious plan exclaimed  2758
Alice and she thought over it a little This was quite a new idea to  2763
Alice went on eagerly And how did you manage on the twelfth  2769
Alice and tried to speak but flapper across his eyes He looked at  2783
Alice You may not have lived much under the sea I haven't said  2789
Alice began and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster  2790
Alice What sort of a dance is it No indeed said  2795
Alice and quietly and looked at  2829
Alice timidly It must be a very pretty dance said  2831
Alice Very much indeed said  2835
Alice every now and then So they began solemnly dancing round and round  2842
Alice feeling Thank you it's a very interesting dance to watch said  2868
Alice I've often seen them at dinn she checked Yes said  2875
Alice replied thoughtfully They have their tails in I believe so  2881
Alice It's very interesting I never knew so much Thank you said  2894
Alice Why I never thought about it said  2900
Alice was thoroughly puzzled Does the boots and shoes she repeated  2904
Alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her  2910
Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity And what are they made of  2916
Alice whose thoughts were still running If I'd been the whiting said  2921
Alice in a tone of great surprise Wouldn't it really said  2928
Alice Don't you mean 'purpose' said  2933
Alice a little timidly but it's no use going back to yesterday  2942
Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first So  2950
Alice over  2964
Alice I might as well be at school at once However she got thought  2970
Alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands  2990
Alice said but was dreadfully It's the first position in dancing  3001
Alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come  3007
Alice was Yes I think you'd better leave off said the Gryphon and  3025
Alice Oh a song please if the Mock Turtle would be so kind  3031
Alice by the hand it hurried Come on cried the Gryphon and taking  3063
Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon only What trial is it  3066
Alice quite hungry to look at themI wish they'd good that it made  3088
Alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read  3093
Alice and those twelve creatures And that's the jurybox thought  3102
Alice whispered to the Gryphon They can't have anything to all doing  3111
Alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped Stupid things  3119
Alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders  3124
Alice muddle their slates will be in before the trial's over thought  3128
Alice One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked This of course  3130
Alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled Just at this moment  3196
Alice very meekly I'm growing I can't help it said  3205
Alice more boldly you know you're growing Don't talk nonsense said  3209
Alice I've so often read in I'm glad I've seen that done thought  3270
Alice Now we shall get Come that finishes the guineapigs thought  3284
Alice guessed who it was even before she got into the her hand and  3300
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very  3333
Alice the name  3337
Alice quite forgetting in the flurry of HERE cried  3347
Alice as he said so with great emphasis looking hard at  3362
Alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she had put  3364
Alice What do you know about this business the King said to  3378
Alice Nothing said  3380
Alice Nothing whatever said  3384
Alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates  3397
Alice Everybody looked at  3404
Alice _I'm_ not a mile high said  3406
Alice besides that's not a Well I sha'n't go at any rate said  3412
Alice Then it ought to be Number One said  3417
Alice Why you don't It doesn't prove anything of the sort said  3460
Alice she had grown so large in If any of them can explain it said  3507
Alice But it goes on '_they all returned from him to you_' said  3533
Alice loudly The idea of having the Stuff and nonsense said  3556
Alice I won't said  3561
Alice she had grown to her full size by Who cares for _you_ said  3566
Alice dear said her sister Why what a long sleep you've Wake up  3578
Alice and she told her Oh I've had such a curious dream said  3581
Alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might  3586

extraordinary noise possibly hear you And certainly there was a most  1494
extraordinary way Alice tried a little to fancy to herself what such an  2023
extras asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously With  2695
eyelids so he with his nose As a duck with its  2977
eyes ran picking the daisies when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink  225
eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having  393
eyes to see what was coming It was the White she hastily dried her  466
eyes I'm sure those are not the right words said poor Alice and her  511
eyes inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little  570
eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt in the middle Alice kept her  652
eyes and An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round  1109
eyes half shut tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great  1128
eyes immediately met those of a large blue mushroom and her  1151
eyes like a frog and both footmen Alice noticed had powdered hair  1471
eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his she said to herself his  1505
eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether Alice did not  1658
eyes again to see if there were any she thought and looked into its  1660
eyes very wide on hearing this but all he _said_ The Hatter opened his  1829
eyes Of course of course just what I was going to remark myself  1903
eyes I wasn't asleep he said in a The Dormouse slowly opened his  1998
eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of its  2087
eyes by this time and was going off into a The Dormouse had closed its  2096
eyes appeared and then nodded It's no use Alice waited till the  2344
eyes then it watched the Queen till The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its  2621
eyes So they went up to the Mock Turtle who looked at them with large  2642
eyes He looked at Alice and tried to speak but flapper across his  2783
eyes Tell the reason is here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his  2886
eyes and mouths so _very_ wide but she gained courage as she went their  2953
eyes were after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his  3311
eyes were looking hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager  3598
eyes and half believed herself in Wonderland So she sat on with closed  3616
eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps and make _their_  3630

I can't explain _myself_ I'm afraid sir said Alice because I'm  1178
I don't see said the Caterpillar  1181
I can't put it more clearly Alice replied very politely I'm afraid  1183
I can't understand it myself to begin with and being so many for  1184
I should think you'll feel it a little after that into a butterfly  1191
I know Well perhaps your feelings may be different said Alice all  1196
I think short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely  1203
I am sir said Alice I can't remember things as I I'm afraid  1232

I I'm afraid I am sir said Alice I can't remember things as  1232
I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together usedand  1233
I feared it might injure the brain  1250
I have none But now that I'm perfectly sure  1251
I do it again and again Why  1252
I mentioned before You are old said the youth as  1254
I kept all my limbs very supple  1260
I took to the law In my youth said his father  1269
I have answered three questions and that is enough  1279
I can listen all day to such stuff Do you think  1281
I _don't_ know said the Caterpillar  1299
I should like to be a _little_ larger sir if you wouldn't Well  1306
I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily thought to herself  1313
I ca'n't see you shoulders got to And oh my poor hands how is it  1360
I say again repeated the Pigeon but in a more subdued tone Serpent  1377

I Pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as I was thinking  1400
I tell you said Alice I'm a I'm a But I'm _not_ a serpent  1404
I can see you're trying to Well _What_ are you said the Pigeon  1407
I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never use denying it  1416
I _have_ tasted eggs certainly said Alice who was a very truthful  1419
I don't believe it said the Pigeon but if they do why then  1423
I can say they're a kind of serpent that's all  1424
I know _that_ well enough and what does it matter to looking for eggs  1428
I was I shouldn't want _yours_ looking for eggs as it happens and if  1432
I shouldn't want _yours_ looking for eggs as it happens and if I was  1432

I should frighten them out of their wits So she began size why  1453
I to get in Please then said Alice how am  1498
I could let you out you if you were _inside_ you might knock and  1502
I to get in head But at any rate he might answer questions How am  1506

I hours I _think_ or is it twelve  1604
I never could abide Oh don't bother _me_ said the Duchess  1606
I speak severely to my boy  1625
I beat him when he sneezes  1626
I must go and get ready to play flinging the baby at her as she spoke  1635
I don't take this child away with me thought Alice the open air If  1649
I to do with Alice was just beginning to think to herself Now what am  1668

I think And she began thinking over other rather a handsome pig  1677
I ought to go from here tell me please which way  1695
I don't much care where said Alice  1699
I get _somewhere_ Alice added as an explanation so long as  1703
I don't want to go among mad people Alice remarked But  1715
I suppose so said Alice  1729
I should like it very much said Alice but I haven't been invited  1740
I haven't been invited I should like it very much said Alice but  1740

I said pig replied Alice and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and  1767
I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and I said pig replied Alice and  1767
I ever saw in all my life without a cat It's the most curious thing  1775
I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead  1786
I don't see any wine she remarked  1811
I didn't know it was _your_ table said Alice it's laid for a great  1820
I can guess that she added aloud begun asking riddlesI believe  1833
I do Alice hastily replied at leastat least I mean what I  1842
I mean what I I do Alice hastily replied at leastat least  1842
I I do Alice hastily replied at leastat least I mean what  1842
I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I well say that 'I see what  1846
I well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what  1846
I You might just as well say added the March Hare that 'I like what  1849
I like' get' is the same thing as 'I get what  1850
I sleep' is the same thing talking in his sleep that 'I breathe when  1853
I breathe' as 'I sleep when  1854
I told you butter would not suit Two days wrong sighed the Hatter  1870
I don't quite meaning in it and yet it was certainly English  1896
I was going to remark myself eyes Of course of course just what  1903
I give it up Alice replied what's the answer No  1908
I haven't the slightest idea said the Hatter  1910
I said the March Hare Nor  1912
I think you might do something better with the Alice sighed wearily  1914
I do said the Hatter you wouldn't talk If you knew Time as well as  1917
I don't know what you mean said Alice  1920
I daresay you never spoke to Time  1923
I know I have to beat time Perhaps not Alice cautiously replied but  1925
I have to beat time Perhaps not Alice cautiously replied but I know  1925
I learn music when  1926
I only wish it was the March Hare said to itself in a whisper  1935
I he replied We The Hatter shook his head mournfully Not  1945
I had to sing concert given by the Queen of Hearts and  1948
I wonder what you're at' How  1951
I ask It's always six o'clock now do a thing  1974
I suppose said Alice Then you keep moving round  1982
I vote the young lady tells us a story I'm getting tired of this  1990
I don't know one said Alice rather alarmed at the I'm afraid  1992
I wasn't asleep he said in a The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes  1998
I heard every word you fellows were saying hoarse feeble voice  1999
I can't I've had nothing yet Alice replied in an offended tone so  2029
I won't interrupt you No please go on Alice said very humbly  2051
I dare say there may be _one_ again  2052
I want a clean cup interrupted the Hatter let's all move one place  2062
I don't understand Where did they draw the treacle cautiously But  2072
I should You can draw water out of a waterwell said the Hatter so  2075
I don't Really now you ask me said Alice very much confused  2103
I ever was at in all way through the wood It's the stupidest teaparty  2116
I think I may as well go in at once And everything's curious today  2121
I may as well go in at once And everything's curious today I think  2121
I couldn't help it said Five in a sulky tone Seven jogged my  2148
I heard the Queen say only _You'd_ better not talk said Five  2154
I needn't be afraid of them all  2211
I didn't said Alice I don't think it's at all a pity I said No  2289
I don't think it's at all a pity I said No I didn't said Alice  2289
I said No I didn't said Alice I don't think it's at all a pity  2289

I must go back and see after some Turtle and to hear his history  2615
I have ordered and she walked off leaving Alice alone executions  2616
I never was so ordered about in my life never after it  2631
I don't see how he can _ever_ finish if he doesn't begin herself  2652

I suppose uglifying it exclaimed You know what to beautify is  2722
I can't show it you myself the Mock Turtle said I'm too Well  2740
I went to the Classical master Hadn't time said the Gryphon  2743

I do so like that curious song very glad that it was over at last and  2869
I don't know where Dinn may be said the Mock Turtle but if you've  2878
I believe so Alice replied thoughtfully They have their tails in  2881

I could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning said  2941
I was a different person then because  2943
I It all came different the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully  2961
I might as well be at school at once However she got thought Alice  2970
I heard him declare 'Tis the voice of the Lobster  2975
I must sugar my hair' 'You have baked me too brown  2976
I was a child said That's different from what _I_ used to say when  2984
I should like to have it explained said the Mock Turtle  2993

I think you'd better leave off said the Gryphon and Alice was Yes  3025
I suppose they are the jurors She said animals and some were birds  3104
I beg pardon your and a piece of breadandbutter in the other  3157

I meant the King hastily said and went on _Un_important of course  3392
I sha'n't go at any rate said Alice besides that's not a Well  3412

That's Bill thought At last came a little feeble squeaking voice  1062
that's all I can say they're a kind of serpent  1424
That's the first _Are_ you to get in at all said the Footman  1520
that's why Pig It's a Cheshire cat said the Duchess and  1558
that's a fact You don't know much said the Duchess and  1572
that's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself said Alice  1653
that's because it Of course not Alice replied very readily but  1890
that's it said the Hatter with a sigh it's always teatime Yes  1979
That's very curious she thought But leading right into it  2120
That's right Five Always lay the On which Seven looked up and said  2151
That's none of _your_ business Two said Seven  2159
That's right shouted the Queen Can you play croquet  2265
That's nothing to what I could say if I chose the Duchess replied in  2541
That's the reason they're called lessons the Gryphon remarked  2760
That's enough about lessons the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided  2771
That's all couldn't get them out again  2892
That's [Illustration _The Mock Turtle drew a long breath and said  2938
That's very curious breath and said  2957
That's different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child said  2984
That's the judge she said to name of nearly everything there  3095
that's the jurybox thought Alice and those twelve creatures And  3102
that's all you know about it you may stand down continued the If  3275
That's very important the King said turning to the jury They were  3386
that's not a Well I sha'n't go at any rate said Alice besides  3412
that's the queerest thing No they're not said the White Rabbit and  3442

themselves'  2503
thenalways to have lessons to learn Oh I shouldn't like _that_  977
thenI That would be grand certainly said Alice thoughtfully but  1937
there's no use in crying like that said Alice to herself Come  389
there's hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable person Why  397
there's no harm in trying So she likely it can talk at any rate  564
there's no room to grow up any more added in a sorrowful tone at least  972
there's hardly room for _you_ and no room at all lessons in here Why  980
There's no pleasing them serpents  1385
there's no _one_ with such a neck as that No no You're a serpent and  1415
there's half my plan done and began talking to herself as usual Come  1446
There's no use in knocking said the Footman and that for two  1491
there's no use in talking to him said Alice desperately he's Oh  1537
There's certainly too much pepper in that soup Alice said to herself  1545
There's _plenty_ of room said Alice indignantly and she sat coming  1805
There's no such thing Alice was beginning very angrily but the  2046
there's any one fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that  2331
there's the confusing it is all the things being alive for instance  2355
there's a large mustardmine near here And everything that Alice said  2525
There's a porpoise close behind us and he's treading on my tail  2848
There's a great Not yet not yet the Rabbit hastily interrupted  3150
There's more evidence to come yet please your Majesty said the White  3422
there's It isn't directed at all said the White Rabbit in fact  3436
there's no name signed at the end can't prove that I did  3449
there's an atom of meaning in I'll give him sixpence _I_ don't believe  3509
there's The jury all wrote down on their slates _She_ doesn't believe  3512
there's no meaning in it said the King that saves a world of If  3516
they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people that  930
they'd take the wonder what they _will_ do next If they had any sense  1073
they'd They couldn't have done that you know Alice gently remarked  2018
they'd good that it made Alice quite hungry to look at themI wish  3088
they'll all think me at think nothing of tumbling down stairs How brave  263
they'll remember her saucer of milk at Dinah was the cat I hope  292
they'll do cucumberframes there must be thought Alice I wonder what  1028
they'll do together firstthey don't reach half high enough yetOh  1037
they're a kind of serpent that's all I can say  1424
they're making such a noise inside no one could secondly because  1493
they're sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn't it be murder to leave  1650
they're both mad Hare Visit either you like  1713
they're only a pack of cards after but she added to herself Why  2210
They're dreadfully and then thought she what would become of me  2330
they're called lessons the Gryphon remarked That's the reason  2760
they're like seen them so often of course you know what  2879
they're all over crumbs their mouthsand  2882
They're done with blacking I believe answer  2911
They're putting down their names the Gryphon whispered in reply  3116

things happening While she was looking at the place where it had been  1746
things between whiles and we've no time to wash the  1980

things are 'much of a muchness'did you ever see such a thing as a  2100
things when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice as she stood  2165
things being alive for instance there's the confusing it is all the  2355
things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew  2401
things that make children bitterandbarleysugar and such  2471

things putting  2520

went Alice after it never once considering how In another moment down  240
went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then The rabbithole  243
went down to look about her and to wonder what plenty of time as she  251
went on saying to herself in a Alice began to get rather sleepy and  296
went Alice like the wind and There was not a moment to be lost away  308
went There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she  341
went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach  383
went on planning to herself how she would manage it They must And she  438
went on all the same shedding gallons of moment I tell you But she  459
went on talking Dear dear How kept fanning herself all the time she  477
went on just as usual queer everything is today And yesterday things  478
went on I must be Mabel after all and filled with tears again as she  512
went to the table to measure growing small again She got up and  526
went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the thing Alice  588
went on eagerly There is such a nice little dog near answer so Alice  604
went commotion in the pool as it  613
went on 'found The Mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly  682
went on turning to Alice What else have you got in your pocket it  746
went as if it had lost something and she looking anxiously about as it  896
went hunting about and Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice as she  906
went in without plate with the name W RABBIT engraved upon it She  917
went on that the mouse doesn't get out' Only I don't think Alice  929
went on growing and growing Alas it was too late to wish that She  951
went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out Still she  955
went on taking first one side and then the other and making And so she  983
went mushroom and crawled away into the grass merely remarking as it  1322
went on without attending to her but those hedges the Pigeon  1384
went timidly up to the door and knocked Alice  1489
went on There might be some sense in your knocking the Footman  1500
went in perfectly idiotic And she opened the door and  1538
went on again and not to her so she took courage and  1562
went out but it just missed her a fryingpan after her as she  1637
went on for some while in silence to say which and they  1666
went on Would you Come it's pleased so far thought Alice and she  1694
went on And how Alice didn't think that proved it at all however she  1724
went on you see a dog growls when it's angry Well then the Cat  1731
went on Then you should say what you mean the March Hare  1840
went mad you know quarrelled last Marchjust before _he_  1946
went on so long that they _Twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle_ and  1964
went on in a mournful tone he won't And ever since that the Hatter  1973
went on of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she  2024
went Sh sh and the Dormouse sulkily Hatter and the March Hare  2047
went on yawning and rubbing They were learning to draw the Dormouse  2086
went on that begins with an M such as little shriek and  2098
went in she  2122
went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she and she  2144
went by without nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and  2190
went on What's your name child Alice she  2207
went on What _have_ you been doing turning to the rosetree she  2241
went stamping about and the Queen was in a furious passion and  2324
went on that the Queen was close behind her listening so she  2365
went in search of her hedgehog whether it was her turn or not So she  2402
went back for a little more conversation with her friend again and  2414
went off like an arrow And the executioner  2443
went back to the game the rest of the party  2448
went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule she  2469
went slowly Everybody says 'come on' here thought Alice as she  2630
went up to the Mock Turtle who looked at them with large eyes So they  2642
went on at last more calmly When we were little the Mock Turtle  2665
went to school in the though still sobbing a little now and then we  2666
went on in these words and he  2678

went on again and with tears running down his cheeks  2787
went on you throw the Then you know the Mock Turtle  2813
went on in a deep voice Boots and shoes under the sea the Gryphon  2913
went their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide but she gained courage as she  2953
went on in a trembling voice wrong and she  3008
went Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille the Gryphon  3028
went round the court and got behind him and could _not_ stand and she  3131
went on and most things twinkled after I'm a poor man the Hatter  3235
went on looking Well at any rate the Dormouse said the Hatter  3246
went The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter and  3259
went on _Un_important of course I meant the King hastily said and  3392
went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at know he  3518
